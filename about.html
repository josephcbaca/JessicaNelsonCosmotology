                        <p>My Totem series started in physical form, using acrylic on canvas.  I
                            enjoyed that medium a lot for this series, but once I started getting into basic
                            digital design using Photoshop and Illustrator, I began to see the potential that
                            I really wanted to capture here.  My initial goal from the start was to imagine 
                            capturing the same feeling I receive by standing in front of massive totem poles.  
                            I have always admired the grandiose and intricate architecture of the Pacific Northwest 
                            tribal artform, as a child presented with the history through modern textbook.  To 
                            capture the same feeling I get from this beautiful art, I imagine walls filled upward as 
                            high as the ceiling with stacked pieces one on top of another.  I don't show art much these 
                            days, so to capture a similar aesthetic, I've designed this simple design layout to stack my 
                            pieces as high as I can with as many totems as possible.  But first, I want to start my 
                            introduction off by stating that I am not a descendent of the First Nations of the Pacific Northwest.

                            My name is Joseph Baca and Iwelcome you to my Totem series.  This series is especially
                            important to me for several reasons that I wish to outline here.  Born in Albuquerque, NM
                            my parents witnessed the potential struggles raising a family in the city of Albuquerque
                            and opportunity was presented in Orange County, CA.  We moved when I was three and my
                            sister Julianne was one.  We lived in Placentia on La Jolla Street, an area considered to
                            most in the surrounding areas as less than safe.  A predominantly hispanic neighborhood,
                            my parents were cautious in our upbringing and due to circumstances of the time, they raised
                            us separate from our hispanic roots.  I appreciate them for thinking of our future at this
                            time and their heart has always been in the right place when raising us, but the truth is
                            that we were deprived of our Mexican culture and language so that we would be able to fit in with
                            American culture and society.  We were whitewashed and conditioned to prevent as much discrimination
                            as possible.  I have come to find that this was a very common occurence of the time.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            My father, Albert Baca, was born in the small town of Belen, NM and his lineage ranges from Spanish
                            and Mexican and small percentages of Indigenous tribes of the area.  Me and my sister grew
                            up listening to his large tales about his ancestral background and the who's who of his "Great
                            great greats...".  A lineage test later on in life would only prove how tiny of a percentage his
                            Indigenous roots were.  My mother, Jo Ann Baca, has been larger puzzle to solve.  She
                            found out in her late teens that she had been adopted.  The news reset everything she knew.  It wasn't
                            until later on in her life, when we were in our teens, that she made any attempt to contact her birthmother.
                            As we frequented travel to Albuquerque, sometimes a couple of times a year throughout my childhood, on one
                            visit, she had received a call with the proposal to meet her birthmother.  So, we sought out Candy Lucero in 
                            Monte Vista, Colorado and we would fill a gap of our history that we never knew was largely absent.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Candy Lucero was sixty-six years of age when she passed away.  She gave birth to twenty-two surviving children,
                            my mother included.  We had the pleasure of meeting her twice before she passed.  I will not share her life, as 
                            it is not mine to share, but share my mother's appreciation to Candy for adopting her to two loving parents that
                            were able to provide for her.  This peace was shared with Candy in both of our family's meetings with her and that
                            we have complete gratitude towards her.  What we would further learn from her is that she was 100% Ute and Navajo.  
                            This would change our family dynamic and culture tremendously.  We have gone on to meet a number of my mother's
                            siblings as well, strengthening our own family tree.  But, most importantly we have received answers to questions 
                            we didn't even know we had.  Due to my mother's adoption status, it has been difficult to declare with either the
                            Ute or Navajo Nations.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I am a Native American without a tribe and a Mexican without a language, but I am not lost.  I listen and I learn
                            through my experiences with others and with other cultures whether it be art, food, language, family practices,
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            My intent to share my story is for complete transparency.  My main point is that I hope that my naming this series
                            "Totem" does not offend any Pacific Northwest First Nations tribes.  I only hope to use my art for good, to enrich
                            culture and present a take on Natvie American culture from an outsider that very much wants to be in.  I do not seek 
                            to make profit off of my Totem series.  Any sales from this series will be donated in full to tribes across the United
                            States and Canada.  Please enjoy and contact me with any comments, questions or concerns.
